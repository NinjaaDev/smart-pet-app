# Poppins Font Files

Please download the Poppins font files from Google Fonts and place them here:

1. Go to https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins
2. Click "Download family"
3. Extract the zip file
4. Copy these files to this folder:
   - Poppins-Regular.ttf
   - Poppins-Medium.ttf
   - Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
   - Poppins-Bold.ttf

For now, the app will use the system default font until these files are added.
